# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Climate control for a Polyaire AirTouch 5 HVAC controller, using the
[pyairtouch](https://pypi.org/project/pyairtouch/) library:

- `main.py` — single-script connectivity test (discover, connect, print status).
- `climate_service.py` — long-running service that keeps each room inside a
  configured temperature range, tuned via `config.toml`. Also records per-unit
  samples (temperature, setpoint, power, mode, activity) to `history.db`
  (SQLite, `readings` table, ts in unix epoch UTC) — the data behind the web
  dashboard's charts and activity strips. Also embeds an Ecowitt listener
  (`[weather]` in the config, port 8090): the weather-station console pushes
  reports to it (see ECOWITT.md) and outdoor temperature + solar W/m² are
  recorded to the `weather` table, drawn on the dashboard's combined chart
  (solid grey "Outside" line on the °C axis; sun area in its own small panel
  below the time axis — never a second y-scale). Only one process can bind
  the port, so don't run `ecowitt_listener.py` (now just a standalone debug
  tool) alongside the service. Mirrors its log to `climate.log`
  (rotating, ~1 MB, `service.log_file` in the config) for the dashboard's
  log panel.
- `webui.py` + `webui.html` — stdlib-only web dashboard over `history.db`
  (default port 8765): combined + per-unit temperature charts, JSON/CSV API,
  a service-log panel (`/api/log` tails `climate.log`), and a "Compact"
  toggle (persisted in localStorage) that swaps the charts for small
  at-a-glance status tiles — one screen on a phone. `stats.html` (served at
  `/stats`, data from `/api/stats?days=N`, or `?hours=24` for the hourly
  24h view) is the longer-horizon companion page: per-room runtime bars
  (stacked heating/cooling/idle-on, shared y-scale across rooms, daily or
  hourly buckets), an outdoor mean/min–max chart, and a totals table.
  Runtime is the gap-sum of consecutive on-samples, each gap capped
  at 2× the sample interval so recording outages don't count as runtime;
  buckets are grouped in local time (`readings.ts` is UTC epoch).
  Reuses `load_config` from `climate_service.py`; opens the DB read-only.
  Installable as a standalone Android app: `/manifest.webmanifest` +
  `icon-192.png`/`icon-512.png` (regenerate via an SDF-rendering script if
  the design changes) + `sw.js` (no-op service worker; older Chrome requires
  a fetch handler for installability — it must never cache). Standalone mode
  needs a secure origin — on plain LAN HTTP use
  chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure.
- `com.frederico.airtouch-climate.plist`, `com.frederico.airtouch-webui.plist`
  — launchd definitions for the two services (macOS);
  `airtouch-climate.service`, `airtouch-webui.service` — systemd equivalents
  (Raspberry Pi OS / Linux, paths assume `/home/pi/pyairtouch`).

There are no tests, linters, or build steps.

## Setup and run

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # fish: source .venv/bin/activate.fish
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py 192.168.5.221                 # connectivity check
python climate_service.py --dry-run --once   # one control pass, no commands sent
python climate_service.py                    # run the climate service
```

## Key constraint: discovery across subnets

The AirTouch controller lives on a separate IoT VLAN at `192.168.5.221`. UDP
broadcast discovery does not route across subnets, so directed discovery is
required: the host arg / `AIRTOUCH_HOST` env var for `main.py`, or
`service.host` in `config.toml` for the service.

## System layout (important)

The house has **7 AC units and no zones** — every `AirConditioner` in the
pyairtouch API is one room. Two units are *masters* that dictate heat/cool mode
for their group (multi-split outdoor-unit constraint):

- **MPR** (master) → Bed 3, Bed 4
- **Study** (master) → Living, Master, Bed 2

Group mode is driven by the masters, via
`ac.set_mode(mode, power_on=False)` so the master is not switched on as a side
effect; member units also get their mode aligned to the master's (same
`power_on=False` call) just before a setpoint command, because setpoints apply
to whatever mode the unit has selected. All units — masters included — are
powered on/off
(`ac.set_power(...)`) purely on their own room's demand, and when
`manage_setpoints` is on each also gets whole-degree setpoint commands
(`ac.set_target_temperature(...)`, rounded toward the demand side and pushed
`setpoint_boost` °C past the power-off threshold — units modulate on their own
return-air sensor and taper off before the room sensor reaches target;
power-off is still decided by the room sensor, so the boost can't overshoot
the room).

## Control policy (climate_service.py)

Per-room on/off thermostat with hysteresis, plus sticky group mode selection:
a group flips heat<->cool only when no room demands the current mode, a room
demands the opposite mode, and `min_mode_dwell_minutes` has passed. Per-unit
`min_power_toggle_minutes` prevents compressor short-cycling; while that hold
keeps a satisfied unit on ("pending off"), its setpoint is parked at the room
temperature (floor for heat, ceil for cool) so it idles instead of continuing
to condition the room — the boosted setpoint returns on the next run.
All thresholds live in `config.toml`. Temperatures can be `None` — handle that
when reading `current_temperature`.

`[shutdown]` windows (`"HH:MM-HH:MM"` local time, may cross midnight) switch
everything off for night/away periods: when a window starts, one off pass
powers every unit off (bypassing `min_power_toggle_minutes`) and the control
policy is suspended for the rest of the window. A unit switched on manually
during the window is left on.
